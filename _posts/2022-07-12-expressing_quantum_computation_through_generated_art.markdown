<p>This is my team's project for the IBM Qiskit Hackathon in Melbourne, Australia 2022. We won first place by the judges and won the community vote. Our team included myself, Harish Vallury, Yang Yang, and Gan Yu Pin.</p> 

<p>Quantum computing is notorious for being unintuitive and difficult to imagine. This python module attempts to create some kind of connection between a human observer and the complex workings of quantum computation by transforming quantum algorithms into music videos.</p>

<p>A python library that can be included into your qiskit project and used to convert your quantum circuit into a music video file.</p>
