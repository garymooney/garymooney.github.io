qMuVi is a python library that can be used by your qiskit project to convert quantum circuits into music video files.

Quantum computing is notorious for being unintuitive and difficult to imagine. This tool attempts to create some kind of connection between a human observer and the complex workings of quantum computation. By transforming quantum circuits into music videos, it allows you to "hear" and "see" how a quantum state evolves as it is processed by a quantum algorithm.

qMuVi was originally created for the [IBM Qiskit Hackathon Melbourne 2022](https://github.com/quantum-melbourne/qiskit-hackathon-22). It won first place by the judges and also won the community vote. From left to right, our team was Yang Yang, myself (team leader), Harish Vallury, and Gan Yu Pin.

The project is still in active development by Harish and myself.
