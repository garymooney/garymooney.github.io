Our team's project for the IBM [Qiskit Melbourne 2022 Hackathon](https://github.com/quantum-melbourne/qiskit-hackathon-22), Australia. We won first place by the judges and also won the community vote. From left to right, our team was Yang Yang, myself (team leader), Harish Vallury, and Gan Yu Pin.

<p>Quantum computing is notorious for being unintuitive and difficult to imagine. Our project attempts to create some kind of connection between a human observer and the complex workings of quantum computation.</p>

We made a python library that can directly convert qiskit quantum circuits into music videos.
