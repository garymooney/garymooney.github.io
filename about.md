<b>Hi, I'm Gary Mooney</b>. Welcome to my page! This will mostly be an archive of research output and projects that I've shared online. I'll get around to adding some of my art at some point too.

### Research
I've recently submitted my PhD, of which focussed mainly on two areas of quantum computing: optimising the process of mapping problems onto quantum computers, and the generation and detection of entanglement within quantum devices. I'm now a postdoc at the University of Melbourne as part of the [IBM Quantum Network Hub](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/quantumhub), working on quantum computing approaches to combinatorial optimisation problems in the automotive industry.

### Game Development
Making games has been a strong passion of mine since I was young. I taught myself programming with the help of [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) and later completed an advanced dimploma in game development (programming) at [AIE](https://aie.edu.au/) in Melbourne. I've gradually been improving my skill set over the years with the aim to excel in all aspects of game creation, especially programming, gameplay/mechanics design, visual design, and art. I enjoy fleshing out game ideas and have worked on many small game-related side projects over the years. 

I'm currently working with a couple of friends on a series of small game projects, the first of which is [Carnival Madness](https://garymooney.itch.io/carnival-madness), available on itch.io. Follow me on social media to keep up to date!

### Bouldering and Sport Climbing
Ever since giving bouldering a go in the beginning of 2021, I fell in love with the sport. It's sort of like having to solve problems using your body while doing yoga and parkour on a wall. I don't know, but there's something about it that just feels right. 

Videos of some of my climbs are occasionally shared to my instagram [@_garymooney](https://www.instagram.com/_garymooney/).
