<b>Hi</b>, I'm Gary Mooney. Welcome to my page! This site is an archive of research output and projects that I've shared online. I will eventually get around to adding some of my art as well.

### Research
I've recently completed my PhD focusing on three different areas of quantum computing: benchmarking current IBM Quantum devices by generating and measuring quantum entanglement, optimising the process of mapping problems onto noisy near-term quantum devices, and exploring ways to decrease the quantum resource costs of large-scale universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. I'm now a researcher at the University of Melbourne as part of the [IBM Quantum Network Hub](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/quantumhub), collaboratively working with Ford on quantum computing approaches to combinatorial optimisation problems in the automotive industry.

### Game Development
Making games has been a strong passion of mine since I was young. I taught myself programming with the help of [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) back when youtube and online tutorials weren't really a thing and I later completed an advanced dimploma in game development (programming) at [AIE](https://aie.edu.au/) in Melbourne. I've been learning and practicing a bunch of different aspects of game creation over the years with the aim to make my own games. I love fleshing out game ideas and working as part of a team to make them a reality.

Last year (2021) a couple of friends and I published our first game. I mean, it's a small experimental game that you can play for free on itch.io called [Carnival Madness](https://garymooney.itch.io/carnival-madness). It was heaps of fun to make and quite satisfying to finally complete and get it out there. I'm developing my next game now in a totally different style with the help of another friend. At a certain point in developing it, I'll start posting updates on my social media (probably instagram). So be sure to follow to keep up to date.

### Bouldering and Sport Climbing
Ever since giving bouldering a try at the start of 2021, I fell in love with the sport. It's sort of like having to solve problems using your body while doing yoga and parkour on a wall. I don't know, but there's something about it that just feels right to me. 

You can find some of my climbing videos on instagram [@_garymooney](https://www.instagram.com/_garymooney/).
