<b>Hi, I'm Gary Mooney.</b> I'm a quantum computing researcher and game developer. I'm passionate about learning how to learn.

<p>I'm currently a quantum computing postdoc working in the IBM Quantum Network Hub at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My work focusses on the compilation process of mapping a problem onto a quantum computer to be solved in an optimised way. My work also focusses on the generation and detection of entanglement within quantum devices.</p>
