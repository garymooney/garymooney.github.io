I've recently completed my PhD focusing on three different areas of quantum computing: benchmarking current IBM Quantum devices by generating and measuring quantum entanglement, optimising the process of mapping problems onto noisy near-term quantum devices, and exploring ways to decrease the quantum resource costs of large-scale universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. I'm now a research fellow at the University of Melbourne as part of the [IBM Quantum Network Hub](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/quantumhub), collaboratively working with Ford on quantum computing approaches to combinatorial optimisation problems in the automotive industry.

<b>Fig.</b> "Optimal embedding of a complete graph onto a quantum annealing architecture with nearest-neighbour couplings," depicted through my submission to the <a href="https://www.cqc2t.org/">CQC2T</a> Quantum Graphics Competition (2018). The image showcases a modified simulated annealing algorithm I coded during my masters degree, which uses Visual Effect Graph's particle systems in Unity to represent clusters of connected nodes. The goal of this optimization problem is to color these clusters so that every colored cluster is connected to every other colored cluster, while using as few nodes as possible.
