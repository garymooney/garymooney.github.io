I've recently submitted my PhD, of which focussed mainly on two areas of quantum computing: optimising the process of mapping problems onto quantum computers, and the generation and detection of entanglement within quantum devices. I'm now a postdoc at the University of Melbourne as part of the [IBM Quantum Network Hub](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/quantumhub), working on quantum computing approaches to combinatorial optimisation problems in the automotive industry.
